# Dev Log

### 3/27/25:11:30-12:00  
Got line input working. Was a bit messy (Had an unnecessary parentheses around some elements that was being evil)  
using the `prompt?` function provided, implemented it  

### 3/27/25:12:00-12:30  
Now splits the line input into sub arrays properly. Whitespace also works well with this  

### 3/28/25:12:00-12:30  
Now properly checks if the line has correct characters
